# Trello Gamification Powerup

Hello!

Weâ€™re a group of enthusiastic students, specializing Digital Media from University of Bremen and the University of the Arts (in Bremen, Germany).

We love Trello. Trello is an integral part of our work. We use it for most of our projects, on and off the university campus. As researchers and designers, who are passionate about Trello, we thought to ourselves, how can we help make it even better?
So as a part of our Gamification and Game Studies course, we conducted research and developed a prototype with a gamification layer for Trello.

Our work was done in two phases.

Phase one, in which, we studied the motivation at work and how people are motivated to use a tool like Trello and how a method like Gamification could help the mix.

Phase two, in which we studied the Trello system, UI/UX of the system and created a prototype of Trello that is structured with game mechanics and elements. We proposed the gamification as a power up that can be turned on/off, but was designed to be well integrated into the backbone of the system. Our work was done before the opening up of the Trello Power up Platform, and hence the prototype was crafted with the main system in consideration.

We really want to see it actually helping people so feel free to use or improve our research.

Let's make together trello even more awesome! ^_^
